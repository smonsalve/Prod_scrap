Im a 32 DDD and one reviewer posted that she was my size but found that the 34 DD worked out for her.  In my case it was just too large and I'm sending it back.

{"review_body": ["Let me start off by saying that I am well endowed. My cup size is a DD, and I've always had a hard time finding bras that fit me properly and feel comfortable. I've always loved push up bras the most, because they look the best, but they have always hurt my upper back, right in between my shoulders, and on my shoulders. I started a new job that requires more shoulder movement and I was in unbearable pain, so I was looking for solutions and I stumbled upon this bra and decided why not? and purchased it.", "It was shipped to me in a timely manner, it took a day or two to be processed and then I got it in 2 days.", "Now the pros...", "1. It fit perfectly. Before purchasing this I was wearing the wrong size normal bras. I had only recently realized that the bras I was wearing were too small, so I had experimented with different cup and band sizes and eventually found one that fit my measurements properly. So, I had ordered my recently adjusted band and cup size. At first it was a little snug and I had worried that it was the wrong size after all or that the measurements were weird or something. The first two days they left red marks around the waist band. But after about a week that stopped happening and now it fits wonderfully.", "2. It stopped my shoulder pain for the most part! Obviously, there are going to be days when even a proper fitting bra won't help. However, I noticed an immediate relief when I switched to this bra. I only wear it while working, because other bras look nicer, and I have noticed a huge difference in pain levels. There are plenty of other reviews that say that this bra didn't help the pain and it made it worse... but that is not the case for me. The only explanation I can thing of is that back pain can be caused by a lot of different things, and perhaps posture/improper back support is not the reason your back is hurting. There could be underlying causes that this bra cannot fix. But my issue was in my upper back and it was due to my breasts being too heavy and needing more (well balanced) support. So while it may not work for everybody, I have a feeling if your issue is what mine is, this bra should work as intended.", "3. The cups eventually mold to your breast and look pretty good under a shirt. At first I was nervous because the cups were a little weird (when you buy it I'm sure you will notice) but just give it a week and it will fix itself.", "4. Very good quality. The material is nice and sturdy and the bra seems nicely built/designed.", "However, there are cons..", "1. Definitely not a \"sexy\" bra. Most certainly not for intimate time. There are many many hooks that are slightly annoying, albeit essential.", "2. It does take awhile for the bra to mold, so for a few days or so I was a little self conscious about wearing the bra in public.", "3. It is a minimizer. I wish there was a magical push up bra that was able to give full back support/posture correction, but alas to my knowledge there is not. I'm not embarrassed of my breast size, and in fact I really like it and it makes me look unproportional with a minimizer. However, for comfort it is worth it. And honestly, the bra doesn't look that bad, but even if it does, the fit makes up for it.", "After using this bra I don't think I will ever buy a different brand (for work purposes anyways). I am extremely pleased and will be buying more soon.", "I have a fairly serious back problem that gives me trouble with my posture.  This bra is very good for keeping my shoulders up and not hunched. And I like the way the length of the wide straps can be adjusted to fit.  I'm not too fond of the front closure, but it's better than having to step into a bra and pull it up like a bathing suit.  I am wearing it today for the first time and am tempted to order a few more and throw away all of the bras in my drawer...none of which feel as \"right\" as this one does. But I'll give it a test run today and see how I feel tonight.", "I find it impossible to hook when on, so I hook it and then squeeze it over my head.  I agree with others that it doesn't \"make\" you have good posture, but it certainly reminds me to pull my shoulders back, and this is the first posture correcter that hasn't rubbed me raw at the bend under my arms.", "As long as you don't wear a tight shirt over it, it looks great under clothing.  I mainly wear it at home all day and put on my other bra when going out.  My usual bra drives me crazy all day and this bra is really comfortable all day.", "My neck and back feel so much better now that I am wearing this bra everyday.  I bought two of them in nude and one in black.  I no longer have knots the size of golf balls in the trapezius muscles and my neck doesn't ache me like it used to.  LOVE this bra!!!!  It works!!!!", "I love the way this bra fits and feels. It's a very comfortable bra. BUT, be SURE you wash it before wearing. I got a breast infection that I am sure came from the bra. Maybe my breasts are extra sensitive, but both sides got very tender after a couple of days of wearing this bra. Only one side got infected, though. If you've gained 10 or 15 pounds since you bought a new bra, be sure to go up a size. Overall, this is a great bra.", "Size 34C. I ordered this bra for posture correction only as I do not need heavy/firm wrapped up like a mummy support for the front half!  This bra is absolutely useless for any type of posture correction or back support!!  It is VERY hot, completely covers the top half of your body and somewhat claustrophobic!! It does not fit well underneath most of my clothing due to the extreme coverage of the bra, be prepared to wear a turtle neck. I have tried adjusting it every way possible and it is not what I expected!! I am very disappointed in the product!!!! I would not recommend this product!!! If you have humongous breasts that need mummy type support and total discomfort  then it may be the bra for you! Wow almost 60 bucks going in the trash!!! Very unhappy customer!!", "This bra would serve as a great and comfortable minimizer bra for busty women, but it is in no way adequate as a posture bra. The stretch knit is too light. It is constructed well with adjustments across the shoulders and in the front, which help make it comfortable. But it is not structural enough to provide posture correction. It has way too much give in the fabric.", "Review by Mrs Mara:", "This back support bra arrived today, a couple of days early and I was very excited. I had previously ordered a different Leonisa bra in 38C which fir perfectly and really pulls my shoulders back. I ordered this one in 40C, thinking it might be even more comfortable, but to my surprise it's much too big by several inches, even with the hooks on the front closure as tight as possible. So I see myself forced to exchange it for 38C or even a 36C. I'm astonished that bras from the same company are so very different. Apart from that problem, I really like it, especially the adjustable shoulder straps!", "I don't know how this bra fits.  I did not even try it on.  It is advertised with \"molded\" cups.  They are not.  May be double lined with thin fabric at best.  I guess it was my fault.  I thought molded cups were actually just that with some cup insets that give you shape and support.  It has to go back.", "I would recommend ordering a band size down, I initially had to return the first one ordered through Leonisa, the smaller band fits perfect though. I would also highly recommend inserting removable liner or thin bra pad to increase coverage due to see through. I personally have struggled with back pain for the last 6 years due to poor back supportive bras. I had nearly given up and was about to go for a reduction surgery before finding this bra. My back pain went away almost immediately upon wearing this bra. I have spent thousands of dollars on different kinds of bras over the years, this is the best solution out there that literally takes back and shoulder pain away and makes life manageable again."], "rating": ["5.0 out of 5 stars", "3.0 out of 5 stars", "5.0 out of 5 stars", "5.0 out of 5 stars", "4.0 out of 5 stars", "5.0 out of 5 stars", "5.0 out of 5 stars", "1.0 out of 5 stars", "2.0 out of 5 stars", "4.0 out of 5 stars", "2.0 out of 5 stars", "5.0 out of 5 stars"], "review_date": ["on June 11, 2014", "on September 19, 2014", "on October 31, 2016", "on March 9, 2017", "on March 20, 2017", "on July 9, 2017", "on April 29, 2017", "on June 8, 2015", "on January 17, 2017", "on December 27, 2017"], "author": ["Megan Hites", "Mary Jean Mayer", "Coach Tracie Irvine", "Jo Ann S.

{"review_body": ["The way it fits if you slump forward it rubs the front of your arms. So you sure slump less! Good upper back support, no jiggle or show through. Gives mild monoboob under a close fitting shirt but worth it to have the posture support when you want it and the uplift helps you look more trim. Fabric is somewhat hot and straps are a bit narrow (which doesn't make any sense at all as this bra is clearly aimed at women with larger cup sizes). Hey Leonisa: widen those straps and soften the fabric and you will have the best posture bra on the market as far as I can tell!", "Let me be clear here- I love how it supports and how it immediately eased the tension across my back and shoulders when I put it on. All day long, I felt more comfortable and felt as though I was sitting and standing straighter. (As another reviewer suggested, don't try wearing it all on the first day, because you'll discover that you have sore muscles the next day. I should have listened to that bit of advice.) The only thing wrong is that I wish they made it in a larger cup size. I'm usually a 42DD, bought it in a 40DD, the largest they make, and this squishes them up a bit too much.  If they just made it a cup-size larger, I would have traded this in for a bigger cup. One thing I really like about this bra is the hook-style shoulder strap adjustments! Sure it doesn't give you a lot of options like a slide-adjuster does, but it's really nice not having a plastic adjusting- slide digging into my shoulders all day.", "This is a great looking bra and is easy to put on with the front closure.

One, the top of the front closure is too bulky and shows through clothing right in the middle, so it draws attention when it shouldn't and keeps you from having a smooth look.  Second, the bottom of the front closure itches and cuts into the skin, making it uncomfortable.  After a few washings, the bottom does tend to irritate a little less, but it's still an issue.", "Third, it does not provide the support it claims to provide.  This is my biggest issue with it. I'm accustomed to wearing underwire bras, but have not found one with decent straps that hold as they're supposed to.  This bra has decent straps, but I find by the end of the day, the 'girls' are 'rolling over' the bottom band and not in their starting position in spite of the nice straps.", "I kept it even with the above issues because it was better than my old underwires.  Next time I order a bra, I will try a different style and/or brand.", "Within my first 5 minutes of wearing this bra I already knew it was useless. There was no strength in the bands to pull your shoulders back or offer any stability to correct your posture. There isn't any sort of cup padding, so there's is nothing left to the imagination at all. Under the arms there is very abrasive fabric that causes rubbing and irritation. Very uncomfortable and doesn't do what it's supposed to do.", "The fit was horrible overal and I was really looking for something to assist in posture and be tighter on the back to pull my shoulders back and it did absolutely nothing at all. The whole thing was uncomfortable as well. Just wasn't what I expected at all. Sent it back", "I haven't worn a bra in a long time but my posture was slipping, so I bought this for posture correction.  I'm not sure it's doing the job at least to my expectations, but I still give it high marks for comfortable fit.  The padded shoulder straps is a nice comfort-added touch.  I have sloping shoulders, so most bra straps slip down my shoulders no matter how much I adjust them unless they are racer-back or x-back bras. The bra straps in this product doesn't come down because of the high back.  All the posture corrector bras I've seen state that you should only wear them 15-20 minutes at a time until your muscles get used to them.  I wore mine to work and spent a normal 9 hour day in them the first time and experienced no problem.  As for support, that comes from the material which is just a tad stiffer than the bra material one gets from a typical Victoria's Secret racerback bra--but without the wire.  Please note that this bra is not padded, so if you wear bras to hide \"the points\", it may not do the job.  For those of you who don't like stiff material against your skin, I wear mine over my soft thin undershirt.", "Should have come with instructions to gradually increase wearing time. I wore it for a full day the first time and had terrible pain in upper back muscles. I eventually was able to wear it longer but it took time.", "I ordered this bra in the size I usually wear but found it is a bit big. I love it though and ordered 2 more in a size smaller.
